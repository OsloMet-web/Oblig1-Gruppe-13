        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Imagine that three years from now, you have finished your degree at OsloMet and have just been recruited
            to one of the largest consultancy firms in Norway. In the first week in your new position, you are told by
            your supervisor that, in addition to your individual tasks, you will be working with a small team of 5-6
            people, who regularly meet to discuss and find good balanced solutions to complex situations and problems
            within the company or society in general</p>
        <h2>Case</h2>
        <p>Your first assignment as a group is to investigate the pros/cons of working in a group. In what areas can you
            contribute. What sort of situations, problems or cases are best solved in groups? What does this way of
            working say about what your company focuses on?
            Use the form below to discuss such issues. Attempt to stay within the set timeframe. Submit the completed
            form in Canvas. At the end of the form is a suggestion for a group contract. It is recommended that you fill
